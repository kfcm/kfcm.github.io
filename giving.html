				<h2>Ways You Can Help Suppport Our Mission</h2>
				<p></p>
				<p>We live in an area where the majority of people are either Muslims or followers of traditional religions. Our mission is to win as many souls as possible for God's Kingdom and it's been a challenging experience. Your contribution is not just a donation. It will go straight into providing us with the necessary resources to build a strong foundation for God's Kingdom here in Kanana and the sorrounding areas. You can contribute money, equipment or people to help support us. Thank you.</p>
