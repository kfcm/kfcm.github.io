                        <h3>Program</small></h3>
                        <p> We have a simple Sunday Program that we try to follow as strictly as possible because we believe that our God is a God of order, not chaos.                            
                        </p>

                                    <p>This is strict prayer time. We gather very early in the morning when it is quiet to conduct various prayers. We pray for the nation, our people, the churches, sunday services, the widows and widowers, the orphans, the sick, those on special needs, etc. We also conduct our testimonies session during this time.

                                    <p>This is where the children engage in various fun activities, such as coloring pictures, reciting poems, singing and dancing, etc. We also try to identify each child's gifts and talents and try to nurture them in God's way.

                                    <h4>Bible Study (New Believers Class)</h4>
                                    <p>We dedicate this time to new believers who are still trying to understand their place in God's Kingdom. We begin by telling them our beliefs, followed by a journey through the Bible, starting with the Creation, the Fall, the Redemption and, lastly, Glorification. The intention here is to build a strong foundation of sound doctrine in their lives.

                                    <p>This is an important time. During this time we invite the Holy Spirit to come and speak to our hearts (inner man)by a series of prayers and worship songs. This gets us in the mood for the main service. The atmosphere becomes conducive for people to receive God's Word.

                                    <p>We kick of the service by a presentation from the Sunday School team followed by call upon the congregation to give their tithe and offerings which we then pray for. We also introduce any new members to the Church, welcome them and meet them briefly for a one-on-one session after the service. We then introduce the main speaker by a few praise and worship songs followed a prayer. The main speaker, who can be the Senior Pastor or an invited Guest Speaker, then delivers the sermon. We conclude the service by an altar call, where we call out those who want to receive Salvation and pray for them. We then pray for the sick, the needy and those with various needs in the Church.

                                    <h4>Lunch Break (Feeding Program)</h4>
                                    <p>We started this program to cater for a basic need that most of the people here lack: food. Most families here cannot afford to have three meals a day. This is why we wanted to step in as a church and see what we can do to help out despite our limited resources. Everyone who attends our Sunday church services are always assured of a free lunch after service. We also see this as a good strategy to attract and retain members. If you choose to you may <a href="{{ site.url }}/giving/">support our efforts</a> in this endeavour. May our Almighty God be praised.

                                    <p>Most people think of Christianity as a spirit-focused religion. We believe Christianity not only provides us with the means to nourish our spirits but our bodies too. Our bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit and, as such, we ought to keep them in good working condition by exercising regularly. Our Youth Sports Program is our initial effort along this line and it is our sincerest hope that we will have more similar programs in the future.

                        <p>This schedule is subject to change as time goes on and as God helps us to grow into a bigger church with a bigger congregation and more activities.</p>
