						<p>I first heard God's voice in 2006 when I was working as a Clerical Officer and Salesman for a dried-flowers firm in Nakuru, a town located in Kenya's Rift Valley region. God was compelling me to move to Mombasa, Kenya's famous coastal city. I did not know the nature of this sudden compulsion to leave my comfortable life behind. Like Jonah in the Bible I dismissed this voice at first. My own family's discouragement to move also helped me ignore this "voice".</p>
						<p>I ended up moving to Mombasa, but not to serve God. I wanted to open my own flowers business since I had the skills. Little did I know that God, all-knowing, all-powerful and everywhere, had other plans for me (Jeremiah 29:11).</p>
						<p>In the wake of the 2007/2008 post-election crisis, my business premise and entire stock got burnt to ashes one night. I lost my family and I's entire livelihood. In essence I had gone back to zero. I did not know what to do or how I was going to feed, clothe or house my family.</p>
						</div>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p>But in this state of uncertainty, fear and confusion I heard God's voice again. This time it was louder and clearer. God wanted me to serve Him. He led me to Ukunda Baptist Church in Ukunda, a town in Kenya's South Coast region. I served as a Deacon here for about two years until they decided to plant a church in Kanana, a town located far from Ukunda. Kanana is a small center with a predominantly muslim population and people who still follow their traditional way of life. This, to me, was the beginning of a challenging experience because I had to face the fact that people would automatically be resistant to Christian doctrines.</p>
						<p>Undeterred and obedient to my God's calling I took up this Ministry. I do not regret this decision. Kanana has been my home ever since I set foot here and I am glad I am in a position to win more souls for Christ.</p>
						<p>Amen.</p>

					</p>
