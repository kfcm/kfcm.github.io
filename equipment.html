				<h2>Equipment Donations</h2>
				<p></p>
				<p>We're located in an area where the Christian population is very low. Church attendance is equally low. Giving is also a problem due to high poverty levels. As a result, the Church's finances are limited. This has made it difficult for us to deliver on our mission. But financial giving is not the only way you can help us.
				</p>
				<p>You can donate equipment you don't use anymore. For those kind souls willing to donate equipment but are living outside Kenya's Coast region, or outside the country, please consider paying for the shipping expenses too because we may not be able to do so ourselves. God bless you.</p>
