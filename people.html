				<p>"You are no longer strangers or foreigners, but fellow citizens with God's people and members of the household of God." â€” <strong>Ephesians 2:19</strong></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Walking with Christians from around the world can enhance the life, faith and witness of any church. When Jesus urged his followers to go out into the world and share the Good News, His intention was for us to create, expand and enjoy the fruits of a global Christian church.</p>
                <p>One way to heed this command is for us to join hands with our brothers and sisters from churches from all over the world. We are, after all, God's Children, members of the same household. We therefore invite other churches to join us in serving our Heavenly Father by putting in place a People Exchange Program.</p>
                <p>An exchange program will be of great benefit to all participating churches.</p>
                <p>For one we'll get to share our faith and experiences. In our opinion, this will help us grown stronger in faith and be appreciative of other people's experiences.</p>
                <p>Secondly, being in direct contact with people of other cultural backgrounds and societies will make us appreciative of God's creation and His plan to unite people of diverse backgrounds.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, as we get to see life's challenges from other people's perspectives we might be able to find solutions to our own challenges.</p>
                <p>This is a big step for our Church but we know that it is what God wants us to do. If you'd like to join hands with us in making this happen please <a href="{{  site.url }}/contacts/">contact us.</a></p>
